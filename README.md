# Loosely Connected Concepts #
This is a mod targeted at the most recent snapshots of Minecraft aiming to be a vanilla-like expansion to the base game.
It features blocks, items, mobs, biomes and dimensions that stand on their own, but also connect with each other.

** This mod is currently being ported to Fabric and is not feature complete. **

You can read more about the predecessors Aimless Agglomeration by clicking [here](https://bitbucket.org/joshmanisdabomb/loosely-connected-concepts/src/master/AA.md) and Yet Another Mod by clicking [here](https://bitbucket.org/joshmanisdabomb/loosely-connected-concepts/src/master/YAM.md).
