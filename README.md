# Aimless Agglomeration #
This is a mod for Minecraft 1.10.2 which aims to bring different stuff to the game.

## Currently in Mod ##

* Vector pearl to save coordinates.

## Plans ##
* Different progression paths for cool items and gear. (Wasteland biome, Rainbow Dimension, etc.)
* Computer system for storing blocks and items. Similar to Applied Energistics.
* Meme power system!
* Space travel, entering pre-made planets and procedurally generated planets.
* Pocket dimensions in a jar.
* Monuments and shrine, adding faith to the player (player owned, like Grid Power from Extra Utilities 2).

* Teleporters to quickly move from one place to another.
* Magrail like system for better, faster, more controllable transport than minecarts.
