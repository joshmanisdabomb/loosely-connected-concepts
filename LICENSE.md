No license, all rights reserved.

The following is not legally binding, but I am a reasonable guy who loves the Minecraft modding community.

This kind of thing won't get you into trouble:

* Playing the mod.
* Using the mod on video and streaming platforms such as YouTube or Twitch.
* Including in a non-commercial modpack with credit (as a dependency in CurseForge counts)
* Contributing to the source of this mod.

This kind of thing may get you into trouble:

* Redistributing the mod as your own work.
* Reposting the mod on dodgy sites, such as those listed by [Stop Mod Reposts](https://stopmodreposts.org/sites.html).

Of course, you can always ask me (joshmanisdabomb) for express permission, such as if you'd like to port the mod to Forge or a new version of Minecraft.
